# üß† Machine Learning Algorithms Showcase - OSTDS Assignment 3

This repository contains various machine learning algorithm implementations using Python. Each script demonstrates a different algorithm applied to real-world datasets with visualization, evaluation, and user interaction where applicable.

## üìÅ Contents

The project includes the following Python scripts:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicts student scores based on study hours.
   - Uses a simple regression model for clear visualization and understanding.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
   - Predicts house prices using multiple features like age, distance to MRT, and convenience stores nearby.
   - Visualizes actual vs predicted prices using map-based plotting.

3. **Polynomial Regression**
   - Predicts car fuel efficiency (MPG) based on features like horsepower, displacement, etc.
   - Applies polynomial transformation for non-linear relationships.

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Clusters customers based on credit card usage behavior.
   - Visualizes distinct customer groups using scatter plots.

5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Reduces dimensionality of customer purchasing data.
   - Visualizes customer distribution across regions using principal components.

6. **Random Forest Classifier (Match Outcome Predictor)**
   - Predicts Premier League match outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win).
   - Includes teams like Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham, etc.
   - Prompts user for home and away teams and displays predicted result.

7. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
   - Demonstrates regularization techniques to avoid overfitting.
   - Compares Ridge and Lasso performance on a regression problem.
